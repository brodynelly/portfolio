## Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on reusability, maintainability, and performance:

- **Layout Components**: Structural components like Navbar, Footer, and page layouts
- **Section Components**: Major page sections (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- **UI Components**: Reusable, atomic UI components (buttons, cards, inputs)
- **Animation Components**: Components that handle animated elements
- **Data Display Components**: Components for displaying project details, skills, and timeline items

Each component is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Minimal dependencies on other components
- **Prop-driven**: Configurable through clear props interfaces
- **Typed**: Fully typed with TypeScript for better development experience
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind

## Animation System

The portfolio utilizes a custom animation system built on CSS animations and React hooks:

- **Scroll-triggered animations**: Elements animate into view as the user scrolls
- **Staggered animations**: Sequenced animations for lists of items
- **Hover effects**: Interactive animations on hover for buttons and cards
- **Page transitions**: Smooth transitions between pages

The `AnimatedSection` component provides a consistent API for adding animations to any content:

```tsx
<AnimatedSection 
  animation="fade-in-right" 
  delay={300}
  threshold={0.1}
>
  {/* Your content here */}
</AnimatedSection>
```

Available animations include:
- `fade-in`: Simple fade in animation
- `fade-in-right`: Fade in from the right
- `fade-in-left`: Fade in from the left
- `slide-in-bottom`: Slide in from the bottom
- `blur-in`: Fade in with blur effect
- `scale-in`: Scale in animation

## Design Principles

The portfolio design follows these core principles:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information stands out through size, color, and positioning
- **Whitespace**: Generous spacing improves readability and focus
- **Typography**: Clear, readable typography with appropriate scaling
- **Color Theory**: Thoughtful color palette that enhances the user experience
- **Consistency**: Uniform design patterns throughout the application
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger 

## Customization Guide

### Updating Personal Information

Personal information is stored in data files in the `src/data` directory:

- Edit `src/data/projects` to update project information
- Modify text content in components like `Hero.tsx`, `About.tsx`, etc.

### Modifying the Theme

The theme is defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. You can customize colors, typography, spacing, and more:

```typescript
// Example color palette customization
colors: {
  primary: {
    DEFAULT: '#3b82f6',
    foreground: '#ffffff',
  },
  secondary: {
    DEFAULT: '#f3f4f6',
    foreground: '#1f2937',
  },
  // ...more colors
}
```

### Adding Projects

Projects are defined in `src/data/projects/` directory. Add new projects by creating entries with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  title: 'Project Title',
  description: 'Project description...',
  image: '/path/to/image.jpg',
  tags: ['React', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind'],
  links: {
    demo: 'https://demo-link.com',
    github: 'https://github.com/username/repo'
  },
  featured: true // Set to true to show on the homepage
}
```

## âš¡ Performance Optimization

The portfolio includes several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Components are loaded only when needed
- **Image Optimization**: Images are properly sized and use modern formats
- **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical resources are loaded on demand
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Careful selection of lightweight libraries
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is removed during the build process
